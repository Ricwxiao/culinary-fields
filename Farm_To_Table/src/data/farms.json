    "bio": "Elizabeth Whitman and Steven Hsieh began dreaming up Tian Tian Farm in 2020 during apprenticeships at organic farms in Oregon. Elizabeth is a second-generation Chinese American. She grew up eating home-cooked kungpao chicken (宮保雞丁), tofu stir fry (豆腐乾), and her grandfather’s hot chili oil (辣椒). Her farming aspirations date back to childhood, when she tried to plant corn, carrots, and cucumbers in the rock-stubbled clay soils of her home state of Connecticut. Before farming, she worked full-time as a journalist in Jordan, New York, and Arizona. Her cat, Scout, is Tian Tian’s director of rodent control. Steven is a second-generation Taiwanese American whose fondest food memories revolve around Sunday morning dim sum. Also a former newspaper reporter, he decided to switch careers after discovering a new kind of joy during misty morning harvests. He lived in Seattle from 2017 to 2018, when he served as news editor at The Stranger."

    "bio": "Tuk Muk Farm is located in the beautiful Sammamish Valley just twenty miles from Seattle. Our 3 acre farm serves local communities in the Puget Sound. Embracing the diversity of the region, Tuk Muk specializes in hard-to-find Asian vegetables, like daikon radish, shiso, mizuna, Chinese onion, Japanese cucumbers and chrysanthemum greens. We’ve dedicated part of our acreage to pastured pigs and chickens. Our animals move regularly in mobile paddocks, hunting and rooting for plants and insects, and ultimately, improving the soil as they go. We use cover crops to preserve and protect the soil and rotate our crops to naturally break cycles of pests and disease. Our goal is to build fertility without relying on store-bought fertilizer and grow the best food we can for ourselves, our families, friends and our community."
